## Introduction

*Introduction to Algorithms*, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS), is a foundational textbook for understanding algorithms and data structures. This repository is a collection of my handwritten solutions to exercises and problems from the book. Additionally, I have created concise chapter-wise notes that summarize key concepts for each topic, making it easier to study and reference.

The handwritten solutions and chapter notes are aimed at helping students, enthusiasts, and anyone looking to deepen their understanding of algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
